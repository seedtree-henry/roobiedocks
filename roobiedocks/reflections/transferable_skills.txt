I studied accounting and mathematics. I have worked on teaching maths for secondary students.
I think that my mathematics logic will definately help me study ruby programming.
Also, I have taought many students and teaching has been the best learning.
As I learn ruby, I am going to teach a secondary student who is interested in programming.
